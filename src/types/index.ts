/** @file Typescript typing information
 * If you want to break your types out from your code, you can
 * place them into the 'types' folder. Note that if you using
 * the type declaration extention ('.d.ts') your files will not
 * be compiled -- if you need to deliver your types to consumers
 * of a published npm module use the '.ts' extension instead.
